# AngularJS-Project
Experimental repository for learning git/github, AngularJS, jQuery and many more technologies and framework. Feel free to provide suggestions and requests.
This AngularJS project was made while learning AngularJs from CodeSchool and I have been developing it since to use it with Bootstrap and jquery.
In future I will use different web dev tools to develop it with different technologies to lean how AngularJS works with them.
